# Chapter 8 - The Monad Remote Script (MRS)
Monad provides a Web Services based mechanism to execute scripts on remote systems. The scripts can be run on a single or large number (many thousands) of remote systems. The results of the scripts can be processes as each individual script completes or the results can be aggregated and processed en-masse when all have finished. A script can be executed in BestEffort or Reliable mode. BestEffort scripts are run from the existing process and if that process terminates, no effort to clean up the remote scripts is done and any outstanding results are lost. Reliable mode scripts are persisted to a local SQL store and a service handles the execution of the script. The user can log of out the machine and the service continues to process the script. The user can log back in and get the results of that job sometime in the future.
